## 🛠️ Create a P2PU account 
In order to best utilize the resources in this course, please <a href="https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/accounts/register/?next=/en/login_redirect/" target="_blank">create a free P2PU account</a>. Your P2PU account will allow you to perform a number of tasks including:
- Create learning circles
- Publicize learning circles
- Manage learning circle event details
- Communicate with learners via email and SMS
- Collect feedback from learners
- Add online courses to our database


Each of these tools is embedded within P2PU’s global community of practice. For instance, when you share feedback about an online course you used or a learning circle, you aren’t just sharing that with P2PU staff; it will be useful for other facilitators who are considering using the same course. To help enable these connections, P2PU accounts also provide access to:
- A group of mentors who can help answer questions when you start your learning circle
- A global community forum
- A monthly digest of what’s happening across the P2PU community
- A mailing list featuring monthly calls and professional development opportunities.


> While you need a P2PU account in order to create a learning circle, learners can sign up with an email address; they do not need a P2PU account. If a learner does not have an email address, you can manually add them to your learning circle and add a phone number so that they can receive SMS reminders and updates.
