# Check-in

*Suggested timing: 10 minutes* 

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand what prep you need to do for a learning circle.
- Feel comfortable using your facilitator dashboard.
- Know what tools and supports are available to you from P2PU.
- Draft messaging for your learning circle.


## Space is the Place
Chances are that you can’t make major changes to the space that you are meeting in for your learning circle. But that doesn’t mean you can’t make a few small changes that will improve the experience for yourself and your peers.

Individually, read our post on the community forum about [setting up a room for learning circles](https://community.p2pu.org/t/how-to-choose-a-good-location-for-learning-circles/2758).  Then, jot down a few notes about what you like about the space you’re currently in and what can be improved.

Once everybody is finished, discuss your thoughts as a group and see if you can come up with at least one thing to change before your next meeting.
